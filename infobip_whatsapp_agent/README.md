# Infobip WhatsApp File Receiver Agent

This agent listens for incoming WhatsApp messages via Infobip and saves any attached files to a local directory.

## Setup

1.  **Install Dependencies**:
    Open a terminal in this folder and run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Run the Agent**:
    ```bash
    python agent.py
    ```
    The server will start on `http://localhost:5000`.

3.  **Expose to Internet (Webhook)**:
    Since Infobip needs to send data to your local machine, you need to expose it. We recommend using `ngrok`.
    
    - Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).
    - Run:
      ```bash
      ngrok http 5000
      ```
    - Copy the `https` URL generated by ngrok (e.g., `https://a1b2-c3d4.ngrok-free.app`).

4.  **Configure Infobip**:
    - Go to your Infobip Dashboard -> Channels and Numbers (or similar setup for your WhatsApp sender).
    - Find the **Webhook** or **Incoming Message URL** setting.
    - Paste your ngrok URL with `/webhook` appended (e.g., `https://a1b2-c3d4.ngrok-free.app/webhook`).
    - Save.

## Usage

1.  Keep `agent.py` and `ngrok` running.
2.  Send a file (image, PDF, etc.) to your WhatsApp number.
3.  Check the `downloads/` folder in this directory. The file should appear there!

## Authentication
The script is pre-configured with the API Key and Base URL you provided.
